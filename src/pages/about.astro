        We believe that building AI should be as simple as assembling LEGO blocks — no code, just intuition.

        The mission behind Namdarine is to democratize AI through modularity,
        visual workflows, and human-first design.

        Namdarine is both a person and a platform.  
        It started as a solo journey — now it's becoming a toolkit for others to build their own AI, without writing code.

      <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed text-md">
        I didn't start out in AI. But as I explored how technology could shape the future, I found myself drawn to the power of artificial intelligence — not just as a tool, but as a language for ideas.  
        <br /><br />
        I eventually shifted my major to AI, not because I wanted to write algorithms all day, but because I wanted to build systems that could understand people — not just data.  
        And what I saw was this: most people are left out of AI because they can't code.
        <br /><br />
        That's why I started Namdarine — to make AI creation accessible to anyone.  
        No technical barrier. No gatekeeping. Just building, learning, and experimenting — as naturally as putting together LEGO blocks.
        <br /><br />
        Namdarine is my vision for a more inclusive future — where AI is not just for developers, but for dreamers, thinkers, and creators everywhere.
        <br /><br />
        <strong class="text-slate-700">Namdarine is not a product. It’s a belief — that AI belongs to everyone.</strong>
