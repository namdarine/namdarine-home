        namdarine began with a simple belief — <br />
        that anyone should be able to build AI. <br />
        As intuitive as snapping blocks together, <br />
        as natural as following a flow. <br />
        Because AI should belong to everyone.

        We believe that building AI should be simple — <br />
        as simple as building with LEGO. <br />
        Not just for engineers, but for anyone with an idea. <br />
        That belief is where namdarine began.

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
        We put people before technology. <br />
        At namdarine, we build AI <strong>of the people, by the people, and for the people</strong>. <br />
        It should be easy to understand, and even easier to create — <br />
        not hidden behind code, but opened up through intuition. <br />
        And now, it's finally reaching more hands than ever.
      </p>
      <p class="text-base text-slate-500 italic">
        namdarine began as a name, a personal journey. <br />
        A solo experiment. A quiet dream. <br />
        Now, it's become a tool — so anyone can build their own AI. <br />
        No code. Just intuition.

      <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed text-md">
        I didn't start out in AI. <br />
        But as I explored how technology could shape the future, <br />
        I realized AI wasn't just another tool — <br />
        it was becoming the line between those who create, and those who are left behind.
        <br /><br />
        So I changed my major. <br />
        Not because I loved writing algorithms, <br />
        but because I cared more about designing systems <br />
        <strong>that resonate with people and serve human intuition</strong>. <br />
        Along the way, I saw one thing clearly — <br />
        <strong>most people are excluded from AI simply because they can't code.</strong>
        <br /><br />
        That's why I started namdarine. <br />
        For an AI anyone can build. <br />
        For a world without technical gatekeeping. <br />
        For a future where exploring, experimenting, and assembling <br />
        is all it takes to bring AI to life.
        <br /><br />
        namdarine is a personal vision — <br />
        and a proposal for a more inclusive future. <br />
        Because AI shouldn't just belong to developers. <br />
        <strong>It should belong to thinkers, dreamers, and makers — to everyone.</strong>
        <br /><br />
        <strong class="text-slate-700">namdarine is not a product. <br />
          It’s a belief — <br />
          that AI should begin with people, <br />
          be built by people, <br />
          and always flow toward people. <br />
