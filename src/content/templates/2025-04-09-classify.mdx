> **Coming June 2025**  
> Classify anything — no code, just clicks.

This template began with a simple question:  
**“What if the entire classification process — from preprocessing to model selection — could be handled automatically?”**  

Namdarine Classify helps you uncover patterns in your data without writing a single line of code.  
Upload your dataset, and the system takes care of everything: preprocessing, smart model selection, and clean PDF reporting.
